* javascript / jquery to listen to the key inputs and cause the movement, keeping track of the score, resetting board.

#### Bonuses

* Deploy your app **publicly online**, where the rest of the world can access it (using a github pages project page or bitballoon)
* Add **movement through CSS** with hover effects, transitions, or keyframe animations.
* Integrate **Object Oriented Programming** design patterns.
* Keep track of **multiple game rounds** with a win counter.
* Allow **customized players** (name, symbol, color, avatar, etc.).
* Use [`localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to **keep track of game state**, even if the user refreshes the page.
* Add **timers** like a countdown timer ("3, 2, 1, Go!"), track the winning time, or track the best time across multiple rounds.
* **Play against a bot**.
* Integrate with a **3rd party API**: flickr, youtube, spotify, giphy, etc.
